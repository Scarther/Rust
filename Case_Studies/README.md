## Case Study Format

Each case study follows this structure:

1. **Scenario Description** - The situation and objectives
2. **Requirements Analysis** - What the tool needs to do
3. **Design Decisions** - Architectural choices and trade-offs
4. **Implementation** - Step-by-step code walkthrough
5. **Testing Strategy** - How to validate the solution
6. **Deployment Considerations** - Production readiness
7. **Lessons Learned** - Key takeaways

## Learning Objectives

After completing these case studies, you will be able to:

- Analyze real security scenarios and identify tool requirements
- Design Rust applications for security use cases
- Implement production-quality security tools
- Handle edge cases and error conditions gracefully
- Optimize for performance in security-critical contexts
- Deploy and maintain Rust security tools
